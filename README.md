# Adv Python for Biologists

I am working on the code samples from the book with the same name.  

## Lessons

There are 7 lessons.

 There includes these concepts: 
* object-oriented Python
* functional programming
* comprehensions
* exceptions
* testing
* recursive functions

## The Book
[Advanced Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/advanced_post/) is the book that covers the code here.  The author, Dr. Martin Jones wrote the original code (first commit), I am working to refactor the samples for my own learning.
