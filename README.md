# Adv Python for Biologists and More

I am working on the Python code samples from the book with the same name.  

I am also working on other coding for bioinformatics topics.  These include the following:
* Scaling machine learning - I have added sample code for the TensorFlow and MxNet libaries.
* Using iPython notebooks - I have added a sample which relates to using Python for data science 

## Lessons

There are 7 lessons or chapters in this book.

These concepts are included: 
* recursive functions
* object-oriented Python
* functional programming
* comprehensions
* testing
* exceptions

## The Book
[Advanced Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/advanced_post/) is the book that covers the sample code in this repo.  The author, Dr. Martin Jones wrote the original Python code samples (first commit),I am working to refactor the samples for my own learning.
