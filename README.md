# Adv Python for Biologists

I am working on the code samples from the book with the same name.  

## Lessons

There are 7 lessons or chapters in this book.

These concepts are included: 
* object-oriented Python
* functional programming
* comprehensions
* exceptions
* testing
* recursive functions

## The Book
[Advanced Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/advanced_post/) is the book that covers the sample code in this repo.  The author, Dr. Martin Jones wrote the original Python code samples (first commit),I am working to refactor the samples for my own learning.
