# Adv Python for Biologists and More

I am working on the code samples from the book with the same name.  
I am also working on scaling machine learning - also adding code for TensorFlow and MxNet.

## Lessons

There are 7 lessons or chapters in this book.

These concepts are included: 
* recursive functions
* object-oriented Python
* functional programming
* comprehensions
* testing
* exceptions

## The Book
[Advanced Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/advanced_post/) is the book that covers the sample code in this repo.  The author, Dr. Martin Jones wrote the original Python code samples (first commit),I am working to refactor the samples for my own learning.
